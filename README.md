# squid_game
Replication of the game RED light GREEN light from Squid game.
Purpose of this project is to get familiar with the javascript language in an interesting, fun way.
# Javascript Libraries
1. Threejs for rendering the 3d image of the doll is a cool feature
2. Used GSAP for automations as well (for the smooth turning of the doll when the light goes from red to green)
