# squid_game
Replication of the game RED light GREEN light from Squid game.
Purpose of this project is to get familiar with the javascript language in an interesting, fun way.
# Javascript Libraries
1. Threejs for rendering the 3d image of the doll is a cool feature
2. Used GSAP for automations as well (for the smooth turning of the doll when the light goes from red to green)
3. GLTF loader to load in the large 3d image into the webpage
